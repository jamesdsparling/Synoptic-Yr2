                     Cape York has a large population of indigenous people, these people represent a very strong 
                     heritage dating back thousands of years, as well as a unique culture. 
                     <br>
                     For years, the people of Cape York have suffered from government intervention
                     due to people in power trying to fix the Aboriginal people's problems for them without consultation. In the recent years, these Indigenous people have been
                     trying to reverse the impact the government has had on them to become truly independent.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     "We do not need our problems fixed for us: we must be enabled to fix them for ourselves."
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     This quote shows their desire to be independent, saying they would just like to be provided with resources to deal with their own problems. 
                     This is where our system comes in:
                     <br>
                     Our system is a live map that shows the people of Cape York realtime, useful information about their surrounding area.

               Due to the intense humid environment in which Cape York is located, fires are a large issue. Particularly in the dry season(Occuring May - October), bushfires or wildfires are a large
               risk in Cape York. Fire management is extremely important because it is key to maintaining biodiversity, protecting the land, and reducing carbon emissions. 
               <br>
               Part of the fire management in Cape York is controlled fires, these are cool and quick burns executed early in the dry season. They are carried out for many reasons: they reduce the need for chemical weed killers,
               save crops/flowers from intense fires later in the year, and are self extinguishing.
               <br>
               <br>
               Our system shows active fires on the satellite map, and when selected describes whether they are controlled or uncontrolled, and how dangerous they are. These
               can be added by admin users and allow for remote monitoring of these fires. This monitoring protects the land, as well as the people of Cape York.

               Water is another issue in Cape York for multiple reasons. Firstly, surface water access and water in cattle areas can easily get contaminated due to cattle backwash.
               <br>
               Another issue is the large variety in water usage from the wet season to the dry season, Cape York is prone to water shortages in the dry season.
               <br>
               The final water related issue is the fact that many water supplies do not need to be operating year-round, because rangers and other workers are only on site in the dry season.
               <br>
               <br> 
               Our solution to this is the addition of water supplies to our satellite map. This indicates where the water supplies are located across Cape York, and when clicked, will show the following:
               Whether the water supply is active(which depends on how many workers are on site due to the season), the distance from the users location to the water source(to aid with shortages), and finally whether
               the water has been contaminated at all by cattle.

               The final piece of information on our map is the location of coral and various plantlife. Cape York is home to a large part of The Great Barrier Reef and some rangers, such
               as Brian Singleton, work with partners in the restoration of this coral as well as seagrass monitoring.<br>
               To have the location, and useful information about the coral and seagrass visble on the map will vastly aid these rangers and workers in their restoration. <br>
               Finally the Rangers of Cape York work with organisations to record cultural and medicinal plants across the land, so our system also has these implemented complete with 
               a description and a precise location.
